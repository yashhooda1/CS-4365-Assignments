Welcome to the 8 puzzle solver program!

Here are the Instructions to run the code

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run the script with the desired algorithm and input state.

4. For Depth First Search, DFS, run this
python Homework1.py dfs 6 7 1 8 2 0 5 4 3

5. For Iterative Deepening Search, run this 
python Homework1.py ids 6 7 1 8 2 0 5 4 3

6. For A* search with heuristic 1, run this
python Homework1.py astar1 6 7 1 8 2 0 5 4 3

7. For A* search with heuristic 2, run this
python Homework1.py astar2 6 7 1 8 2 0 5 4 3


IMPORTANT NOTE: The 0 stands for the * in the 8 puzzle solver, does NOT actually represent 0.

The python program file must be in the same file directory as the python file or these git bash commands won't work.
